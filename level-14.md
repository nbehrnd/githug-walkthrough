# Level 14 rename

> We have a file called `oldfile.txt`. We want to rename it to `newfile.txt` and stage this change.

In level 11, we used `git rm` to delete a file from the repository. Similarly, if you want to rename a file in the repository, instead of using the `mv` command, use `git mv` which automatically logs the changes to the staging area.

The level 14 pass screen looks like this:
