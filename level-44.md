Similar to Linux's grep command, Git provides a grep command for searching text:

``
$ git grep keyword
$ git grep keyword file-name
```

The first command looks for the specified keyword under the current project; the second command looks for the keyword in the specified file.

The level 44 pass screen is as follows:

! [level-44 grep](images/level-44-grep.png)
