# Appendix C Common Vim Commands

The default text editor for Linux is Vim. It equally is provided in within the
`git shell` for instance by [tortoisegit](https://tortoisegit.org/) for Windows
as an additional interface to `git` to the graphical one in the context menu.

Because Vim operates quite differently then text editors with a graphical
interface, here a couple of commonly used commands:

## Switch to editing state

> i

## Switch to command state

> ESC

## Save

> :w

## Exit

> :q

## Save and exit

> :wq

## Exit without saving

> :q!

## Delete characters

> x

## Delete from the cursor to the end of the word

> dw

## Delete cursor to end of line

> d$

## Delete the cursor line

> dd

## Undo

> u

## Paste

> p

## Replace cursor character

> Type r, then output a character
