The next 10 levels are all about branches.
If you want to do safe development without affecting the mainline, you have to create a branch based on the mainline, then make changes on the branch, and finally merge the branch into the mainline. In fact, it is common to work on the branch because in a team, you and your partner share the mainline, and working directly under the mainline will affect other people, so everyone works on their respective branches separately.

The common commands for branching are as follows:

``
$ git branch branch-name
$ git branch
```

The first statement is used to create a branch, branch-name is the name of the branch you want to create; the second statement is used to list all the branches.

The level 31 pass screen is as follows:
