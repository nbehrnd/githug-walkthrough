We've used the `git rebase -i` command to change the history of commits to cancel one of the multiple commits, but that's only if it hasn't been pushed to the server yet; if it has, you can't change the existing history, so you have to figure out another way to do it.

Git provides the `revert` tool to solve this problem, which is the inverse of a commit, for example, if you make a commit that creates a new file, then Git creates a commit that deletes that file. The syntax is as follows:

``
$ git revert hash-code
$ git revert hash-code --no-edit
```

where hash-code is the hash of the commit you want to cancel. The `no-edit` parameter in the second command means that a commit message will be generated by the system; without this parameter, Git will automatically call a text editor and ask you to write a message.
