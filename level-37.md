# Level 37 push_branch

> You've made some changes to a local branch and want to share it, but aren't
yet ready to merge it with the 'master' branch. Push only 'test_branch' to the
remote repository

We learned about the push command in level 28 with the following syntax:

```shell
git push remote-name branch-name
```

where `remote-name` is the remote repository name and `branch-name` is the
branch name.

The level 37 pass screen looks like this:
