# Level 15 restructure

> You added some files to your repository, but now realize that your project needs to be restructured. Make a new folder named `src` and use Git move all of the .html files into this folder.

This is a combination of file renaming! In practice, as the number of files grows, you'll need to reorganize your directory structure and categorize your files. To do this, create a new directory, and then use the `git mv` command to move the files you want to move.

The screen for level 15 is shown below:
