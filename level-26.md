> You need to pull changes from your origin repository.

When you have multiple people working on a project, you're not the only one committing code to the remote repository; your partners are also committing code to the remote repository. To get the latest content from the remote repository, grab the content with the following command:

``
$ git pull remote-name branch-name
```

where remote-name is the name of the remote repository and branch-name is the name of the branch of the remote repository, or master if it's a trunk.After this command is executed, the code from the remote repository is automatically merged into the local project.

The level 26 pass screen is as follows:
