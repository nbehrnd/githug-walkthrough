# Level 26 pull

> You need to pull changes from your origin repository.

If multiple people work on a project, you likely are not the only one to commit code to the remote repository. To get the latest content from the remote repository, grab the content with the following command:

```shell
git pull remote-name branch-name
```

where `remote-name` is the name of the remote repository and `branch-name` is the name of the branch of the remote repository, or master if it's a trunk. After this command is executed, the code from the remote repository is automatically merged into the local project.

The level 26 pass screen is as follows:
