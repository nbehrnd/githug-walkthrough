# Level 55 submodule

> You want to include the files from the following repo:
`https://github.com/jackmaney/githug-include-me` into the folder
`./githug-include-me`. Do this without manually cloning the repo or copying the
files from the repo into this repo.

If you want to use someone else's repository code as a library in your project,
you can use the modularization idea of managing the repository as a module. Git
provides tools for doing this with the following command:

```shell
git submodule add module-url
```

where `module-url` is the address of the third-party repository.

The screen for level 55 looks like this:
