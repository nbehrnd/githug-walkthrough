# Level 33 checkout_tag

> You need to fix a bug in the version 1.2 of your app. Checkout the tag `v1.2`.

In level 17 we learned how to create a tag as a semantic label easy to remember. We can use the version number or other words that have a specific meaning as a tag. When we want to switch to a specific tag, we use the following command:

```shell
git checkout tag-name
```

You must have noticed that this command also has the same form as the command to switch to a branch! Levels 17, 32, and 33 all have the same form of command, but the endings are different because of the meaning of the arguments: one is a filename, one is a branch name, and one is a tag name.

Level 33 passes with the following screen:
