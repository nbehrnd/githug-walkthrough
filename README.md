[Githug](https://github.com/Gazler/githug) is a playful way to familiarize
oneself with key concepts and functions of [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
[Zhang Even](https://githug.zhang-ou.com/) initiated with
[githug-walkthrough](https://github.com/comehope/githug-walkthrough) a key how
to pass the 56 levels of the former project. The interactive character of
`githug`, the ease to reset a level in a setup separate from your valuable
projects managed by `git` is an invitation to try and experiment different
approaches without danger to "break things", or "loose" data and previous work
for good. Instead, you can build "muscle memory".

To provide this project a wider audience
[this fork](https://github.com/nbehrnd/githug-walkthrough) reorganizes Zhang
Even's work. Adopting the pattern used by
[learnxinyminutes.com/](https://learnxinyminutes.com/), earlier answers and
comments by Zhang Even were machine translated into English (US), edited a bit,
and became the presentation's new default.
