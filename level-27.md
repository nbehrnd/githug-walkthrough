In level 25, we listed multiple remote repositories with `git remote -v`. But
how were they added?

If your project is cloned, Git saves the repositories from the clone command.
If you want to add a remote repository manually, use the following command:

```shell
git remote add remote-name remote-url
```

The level 27 pass screen looks like this:
