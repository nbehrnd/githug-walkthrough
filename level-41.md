# Level 41 rebase_onto

> You have created your branch from `wrong_branch` and already made some commits, and you realize that you needed to create your branch from `master`. Rebase your commits onto `master` branch so that you don't have `wrong_branch` commits.
> 
> You've created a branch named `readme-update` from `wrong_branch`, done a few commits on it, and suddenly you realize that you shouldn't have created your branch from `wrong_branch`, but rather from `master`. Now you need to migrate the commits you made on `readme-update` to the `master` branch.

(More on that here.)
