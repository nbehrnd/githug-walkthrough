> A new directory, `git_hug`, has been created; initialize an empty repository
in it.

If you're going to make a local directory manageable by Git, you need to
initialize it first. A local directory can be empty, or it can be a directory
that already has files in it.

The command to initialize a Git repository is:

```shell
git init
```

This command creates a subdirectory called .git, which contains the files that
Git will use to manage your repository. .git is a hidden directory that can be
viewed with `ls -a`.

git is a hidden directory that can be viewed with `ls -a`.
