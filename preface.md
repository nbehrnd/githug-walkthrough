# Preface

Git contains a lot of commands, but you can't learn them by just reading the
documentation; you have to do it. But unlike learning to program, different Git
commands are used to solve problems in specific scenarios, and building
experimental scenarios is cumbersome and not easy to share with others.

Githug was developed for this purpose. It has 55 application scenarios designed
in the form of a game, and every time you pass a level, it automatically builds
the next scenario, including creating the files, commit history, and branches
needed in the scenario.

In addition to commonly used commands such as initialize, clone, and commit,
the game also involves a variety of restore and cancel operations, branching
operations, and log history operations, so you can understand the power of Git
from multiple perspectives.

This book explains in detail the background of the tasks generated in each
level, the ideas and methods to solve the problems, and provides clear passing
screens. I hope this book will help you quickly master Git, and stimulate your
interest in exploring its design principles.

Because of my shallow knowledge and level of limitations, it is inevitable that
the book errors and omissions, I hope that you do not hesitate to give advice,
thank you!
