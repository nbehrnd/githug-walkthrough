As above, you can look up the URLs of remote repositories by adding a `-v` parameter to the `git remote` command.

```
$ git remote -v
```

The query lists the fetch and push addresses for each remote repository, because in some cases the fetch and push addresses are different.

The level 25 pass screen looks like this:
