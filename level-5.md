Recall from level 1, when we were initializing the local directory as a Git repository. In addition to that, there is another case to create a Git repository, which is to clone the repository on the server locally, and its command format is:

``
$ git clone http://remote.repo.url
```

This command creates a subdirectory in the current directory with the same name as the remote repository, and copies all the files from the remote repository into this new subdirectory.

The level 5 pass screen looks like this:
