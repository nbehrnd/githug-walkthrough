# Level 5 clone

> Clone the repository at https://github.com/Gazler/cloneme.

Recall from level 1, when we initialized the local directory as a Git repository. In addition to that, an other way to create a Git repository is to clone the repository on the server locally. It is invoked by:

```shell
git clone http://remote.repo.url
```

This command creates a subdirectory in the current directory with the same name as the remote repository. All files of the remote repository are copied into this new subdirectory.

The level 5 pass screen looks like this:
