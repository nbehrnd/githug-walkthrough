# Level 6 clone_to_folder

> Clone the repository at https://github.com/Gazler/cloneme into the folder
> `my_cloned_repo`.

If you want to name the cloned repository differently than the remote
repository, append a custom directory name to `git clone` like this:

```shell
git clone http://remote.repo.url your-folder
```

The level 6 pass screen looks like this:
