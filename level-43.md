If you have created a branch with multiple commits in it, and when you merge you don't want to merge all the commits on the branch to the mainline, but only 1 of the commits you want to merge to the mainline, then you can use the following command:

``
$ git cherry-pick hash-code
```

where hash-code is the HASH value generated by a commit. cherry-pick translates to cherry picking. Think of a branch as a tree, and multiple commits make the tree full of fruit, so the cherry-pick command is to pick one of the fruits.
